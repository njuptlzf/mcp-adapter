  Fork-maintainer workflow for syncing https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mcp-adapter

  fork's `main` first (decision tree applies here), then propagate fork's
  `main` into the working branch — skipped if already on `main`. Reads
  `skills/upstream-merge/references/special-cases.md` for hand-curated special

# Upstream Merge (fork-maintainer)

Drives the `njuptlzf/mcp-adapter` fork through a deterministic merge of
upstream `nicobailon/pi-mcp-adapter` changes. The flow has two layers:

- **§1 Two-step git branch flow** — the order of merges across branches.
  Read this first to know where the decision tree runs.
- **§2–§5 Per-file decision tree** — invoked within Step 1 of the branch
  flow. Look up the file, apply the decision, verify.

## 1. Two-step git merge flow

The fork has two long-lived branches that the upstream merge must handle
separately:

| Branch | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `main` (fork's main) | **Upstream change buffer** | The decision tree in §4 runs here. Long-lived but rarely committed to directly. |
| `<working-branch>` (e.g., `v1.0`) | Active fork development | Long-diverged from `main` (e.g., 227 commits ahead in this fork). |

**The merge is a deterministic two-step process:**

1. **Switch to `main`** — `git checkout main`. All Step 1 work happens here.
2. **Fetch upstream** — `git fetch upstream` (GnuTLS workaround per the §2
   note if needed).
3. **Run pre-flight** — `npm run upstream:check` (§3) to see live divergence.
4. **Step 1: `upstream/main` → `main`** — `git merge upstream/main`. Resolve
   conflicts using the decision tree (§4). The merge commit lands on `main`.
5. **Step 2: `main` → `<working-branch>`** — `git checkout <working-branch>
   && git merge main`. Generally a fast-forward or small diff because the
   working branch is already ahead of `main` with fork-specific work.
6. **Short-circuit** — if `<working-branch> == main`, skip step 5. The flow
   ends at Step 1.

**Anti-pattern (do not):** Running `git merge upstream/main` directly on
`<working-branch>`. This creates a large blast radius of conflicts between
the long-diverged working branch and upstream — the working branch has
hundreds of commits the upstream never saw. The two-step flow exists to
confine the conflict surface to the smaller `main` branch.

## 2. When to invoke

The decision tree (§4) is invoked within Step 1 of the two-step flow, at
any of three points:

- **(a) Pre-flight**, after `git fetch upstream` and before `git merge
  upstream/main`. Run `npm run upstream:check` (§3) to surface live
  divergence, then walk the per-file decision tree before any conflict
  appears.
- **(b) In-flight**, after `git pull upstream main` produces a merge
  conflict. Look up each conflicting file's `Default Resolution` in the
  manifest, and apply the decision (run the §4.1 grep for `assess` rows
  first).
- **(c) Targeted cherry-pick**, before `git cherry-pick <upstream-sha>`.
  Same flow as (b), scoped to the files touched by the cherry-picked
  commit.

After Step 1's merge commit lands and passes the §5 Checklist, run Step 2
(`git merge main` on the working branch) to propagate upstream changes.
If on `main` already, the flow ends at Step 1.

> **GnuTLS workaround:** If `git fetch upstream` fails with GnuTLS / SSL
> errors in this environment, use `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1 git -c
> http.sslVerify=false fetch upstream --tags` (verbatim from
> `08-LEARNINGS.md` L-4).

## 3. Read the special-cases registry and run the divergence check

Two inputs are required before any merge decision: (1) read `references/special-cases.md` for the 15-17 hand-curated cases (Phase 8 manifest footnotes + expansion), and (2) run `npm run upstream:check` to see live divergence against `upstream/main`. The script replaces the Phase 8 "manifest freshness" check: instead of comparing manifest row counts to `git diff` output, it classifies each diverged file as `registered` / `diverged-but-not-registered` / `stale` against the registry.

**How to look up a file in the registry:**

```bash
# By file path (quote the path with backticks to match the table cell)
grep -F '`init.ts`' skills/upstream-merge/references/special-cases.md

# By status (returns all rows in that bucket)
grep -E '^\| `.*` \| (fork-only|decoupled-wrapper|deleted-in-fork|sibling-config|framing-divergence)' skills/upstream-merge/references/special-cases.md
```

**Run the divergence check** (script replaces the Phase 8 `git diff ... | wc -l` + `grep -cE '^\| `'` sanity check):

```bash
# Default: ANSI color when stdout is a tty
npm run upstream:check

# Grep-friendly output (no escape sequences, suitable for piping / CI logs)
npx tsx scripts/upstream-divergence.ts --no-color
```

**Interpreting the script output:**

- **Exit 0** — no stale entries. The `diverged-but-not-registered` count is a warning (per D-34: treated as `assess` by the 12-category matrix in §4.2); proceed with the merge.
- **Exit 1** — stale entries present (registry lists a file that is no longer in `git diff upstream/main --name-status`). STOP and clean stale registry entries before merging.
- **Exit 2** — fatal: `git fetch upstream` failed AND the GnuTLS workaround also failed, OR the registry parse produced 0 entries. Investigate before proceeding (the GnuTLS workaround per L-4 is `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1 git -c http.sslVerify=false fetch upstream --tags`; the script retries with it automatically).

Files NOT in the registry are resolved by the 12-category per-file default-resolution matrix inlined in §4.2 below — no need to add them to the registry.

### 3.5 Conflict resolution: delegate to `resolve-conflicts` skill (v3.2)

When `git merge upstream/main` produces conflicts, **do not resolve them manually with custom rules**. Instead, delegate to the `resolve-conflicts` skill:

```
Skill /resolve-conflicts
```

The `resolve-conflicts` skill provides a professional, plan-first conflict resolution framework with:
- 7 conflict type patterns (imports, tests, generated files, config, code logic, structs, deleted-modified)
- Structured resolution plan + user approval before executing
- Decision tracking (remember user choices, apply to similar conflicts)
- Validation scripts (`validate-conflicts.sh`, `handle-deleted-modified.sh`)
- One-line explanation for every conflict resolved

**upstream-merge's role**: After resolve-conflicts resolves the conflicts, run §4.1 Pi-coupling grep (advisory) + §5 Checklist to validate the merge result from a fork-specific perspective.

> **Removed in v3.2** (2026-07-01): The previous §3.5 "Conflict hunk independence check" (awk-based 4-category classification + "保留两侧" conditions) and §4.4 "Same-function 5-step protocol" were custom conflict resolution rules that duplicated `resolve-conflicts` skill's functionality. They have been removed in favor of the professional skill.

## 4. Decision tree

Walk these steps in order, branching on the manifest row for each changed file.

**Step 1 — Identify Category.** Read the `Category` column (adapter / interface / source / skill / test / docs / config / planning / agents_meta / other). This alone answers ~70% of cases (see "Fast-path summary" below).

**Step 2 — Branch on `Default Resolution`:**

| Default Resolution | Action |
|--------------------|--------|
| `ours` | `git checkout --ours <path>`; mark "ours" in the merge commit body; jump to §5 Checklist |
| `theirs` | `git checkout --theirs <path>`; run `npx tsc --noEmit`; jump to §5 Checklist |
| `assess` | **遇到冲突时委托给 `resolve-conflicts` skill** (§3.5). After conflicts are resolved, run §4.1 Pi-coupling grep (advisory only — record hit count in commit body, not blocking). |
| `manual` | Open the editor; for each hunk, prefer upstream if generic, prefer ours if Pi-coupled; see §4.3 rule of thumb |

**Fast-path summary by Category** (covers `ours` / `theirs` rows without grep):

- `adapters/<agent>/*`, `adapters/entry.ts`, `skills/*`, `.planning/*`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/*` → **always `ours`** (fork-only or agent-specific).
- `interfaces/*` (agent-api.ts, agent-paths.ts, sampling.ts, etc.) → **`manual`** (line-by-line; upstream remains Pi-specific per D-01..D-03).
- `package.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, `.npmignore` → **`manual`** (line-by-line, prefer fork's structural choices).
- `__tests__/*`, `tests/*`, `examples/*`, `types.ts`, `utils.ts`, `errors.ts`, `logger.ts` → **`assess`** (run §4.1 grep).
- Core MCP source (`init.ts`, `mcp-*.ts`, `lifecycle.ts`, `proxy-modes.ts`, `direct-tools.ts`, `commands.ts`, `state.ts`, `oauth-handler.ts`, `elicitation-handler.ts`, `sampling-handler.ts`, `tool-result-renderer.ts`) → **`assess`** (run §4.1 grep).
- `types/pi-*.d.ts` → **`ours`** (fork-side type declarations for Pi per D-21; declarations ≠ coupling).
- `README.md`, `MAPPING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `OAUTH.md` → **`assess` via intent alignment** (preserve "Universal MCP Adapter" framing per D-18/D-19/D-20).

**Step 3 — Special cases:**

- File is `new` (Status column) + Category ∈ {adapter, interface, skill, planning} → `--ours` (we own the directory; upstream shouldn't add files here).
- File is `deleted` in upstream + still referenced locally → keep ours, add `// deprecated: removed in upstream; kept for fork back-compat` JSDoc (the `panel-keys.ts` precedent from Plan 08-01).

### 4.1 Pi-coupling marker grep (corrected template)

Run the **5 sub-commands** below against the changed files. Each covers a distinct marker class. The `\b` word boundaries and the `types/pi-*.d.ts` exclusion are the corrections from RESEARCH Dimension 3 — without them, every `agentapi.X` call in this fork produces a systematic false positive (CONTEXT's original 8 `pi.X` patterns are DELETED for exactly this reason; see `references/pi-coupling-markers.md` §"DELETED markers").

```bash
# === 1. Type / class markers (HIGH precision) ===
git diff upstream/main --name-only -- '*.ts' | xargs grep -nE \
    '\bExtensionAPI\b|\bExtensionContext\b|\bExtensionUIContext\b|\
\bAgentToolResult\b|\bAgentToolUpdateCallback\b' \
    2>/dev/null

# === 2. Package markers (HIGH precision, exclude .d.ts declarations) ===
git diff upstream/main --name-only -- '*.ts' '*.json' | xargs grep -nE \
    '@earendil-works/pi-(coding-agent|ai|tui)' \
    2>/dev/null | grep -vE 'types/pi-(ai|coding-agent|tui)\.d\.ts:'

# === 3. Env var marker (HIGH precision) ===
git diff upstream/main --name-only -- '*.ts' | xargs grep -nE \
    'PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR' 2>/dev/null

# === 4. UI surface (MEDIUM precision — generic ctx.ui but Pi-style API) ===
git diff upstream/main --name-only -- '*.ts' | xargs grep -nE \
    '\bctx\.ui\.(notify|form|custom|theme)' 2>/dev/null

# === 5. ToolInfo (must filter by import path) ===
# Flag only ToolInfo from @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent or pi-ai;
# the generic one in interfaces/agent-api.ts is fork-owned.
git diff upstream/main --name-only -- '*.ts' | xargs grep -nE \
    'from .*pi-coding-agent.*ToolInfo|from .*pi-ai.*ToolInfo' 2>/dev/null
```

**Decision rule:** Sub-commands 1-3, 5 → 0 hits means Pi-coupling-free (accept `--theirs`). Sub-command 4 (`ctx.ui.X`) is a MEDIUM marker; hits in `commands.ts` are expected and are **not** a follow-up trigger — `ctx.ui` is this fork's generic `UISystem` interface (D-04 / Phase 3). See `references/pi-coupling-markers.md` for the full per-marker inventory and rationale.

> **Note:** The 8 `pi.<method>` call patterns from the original CONTEXT-03-B draft (8 entries enumerated in `references/pi-coupling-markers.md` §"DELETED markers") are **DELETED** — they produce systematic false positives on `agentapi.X` generic adapter calls. They are catalogued only in `references/pi-coupling-markers.md` §"DELETED markers" so future maintainers can see why they are absent. Do NOT reintroduce them in the §4.1 template without re-verifying against the latest codebase.

### 4.2 Per-file default resolution (12-category matrix) and 5-step follow-up flow

#### 4.2a Per-category default resolution

The 12-category per-file default-resolution matrix (sourced from D-23; inlined here per **D-35** so the fast-path and the slow-path special-cases registry are visible in one place). Every diverged file not in `references/special-cases.md` defaults to the action in this table; the special-cases registry overrides only when a file genuinely cannot be resolved by category rules.

| Category | Default | Rationale | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `adapters/<agent>/*` | `ours` | Fork-only; upstream doesn't add adapters | D-21 |
| `adapters/entry.ts` | `ours` | Frozen signature per D-07 | D-07 |
| `skills/*` | `ours` | Fork-only skill additions | D-21 |
| `interfaces/*` | `manual` | Fork-generic; upstream remains Pi-specific | D-01..D-03 |
| `package.json` / `vitest.config.ts` / `tsconfig.json` | `manual` | Line-by-line; prefer fork structural choices | D-21 |
| `.gitignore` / `.npmignore` | `manual` | Line-by-line; prefer fork structural choices | D-21 |
| `__tests__/*` / `tests/*` | `assess` | Run §4.1 grep; mostly legal but watch for new test fixtures | D-24 |
| Core MCP source (`init.ts`, `mcp-*.ts`, ...) | `assess` | Always run §4.1 grep; check D-04 wrapper boundaries | D-24, D-04 |
| `bin/*` | `ours` | Fork-only bin entries; upstream has no `bin/` directory | D-21 |
| `types.ts` / `utils.ts` / `errors.ts` / `logger.ts` | `assess` | Universal utility files; Pi-coupling unlikely but check | D-24 |
| `README.md` / `MAPPING.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` / `OAUTH.md` | `assess` (intent) | Preserve "Universal MCP Adapter" framing | D-18..D-20 |
| `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/*` | `ours` | Fork-specific | D-21 |
| `.planning/*` | `ours` | Planning artifacts are fork-specific | D-21 |
| `types/pi-*.d.ts` | `ours` | Fork-side type declarations for Pi (declarations ≠ coupling) | D-21 |

This matrix covers ~70% of files; the remaining ~10% are the special cases in `references/special-cases.md`. The §4.1 grep runs on `assess` rows before any `--theirs` decision.

#### 4.2b Pi-coupling soft follow-up (advisory, non-blocking) (v3.1)

When the §4.1 grep returns ≥1 hit in core source, the merge is **not blocked**. Best-effort follow-up:

1. **Conflicts resolved by `resolve-conflicts` skill** (§3.5) — accept the resolution result.
2. **Optionally open a follow-up issue** (best-effort, only if `gh` CLI authenticated). Skip if `gh` not authenticated.

> **Removed from v1** (2026-07-01, Phase 13): steps "Stage a follow-up commit that refactors the Pi-coupling out", "Open a follow-up issue" (now optional), and "Reference the issue number in the merge commit body" are removed from the mandatory path. Rationale: fork is downstream, not adversarial. The adapter layer (`adapters/pi-adapter.ts`) provides runtime isolation; Pi-coupling in core is log-only. See `docs/upstream-merge-retrospective.md` §2.1.3 for the full rationale.

### 4.3 `manual` review rule of thumb

For `manual` rows, accept upstream hunks unless they touch a function signature that generic code depends on — the canonical example is `createMcpAdapter(agentapi, ctx, config, cache)` in `adapters/entry.ts`; that signature is frozen per D-07 and any upstream change to it is rejected (`git checkout --ours`).

### 4.4 Conflict resolution: delegate to `resolve-conflicts` skill (v3.2)

When conflicts occur during `git merge upstream/main`, **delegate to the `resolve-conflicts` skill** instead of using custom resolution rules:

```
Skill /resolve-conflicts
```

The `resolve-conflicts` skill handles all conflict types professionally:
- **Imports**: Merge all unique imports, group by module
- **Tests**: Keep all tests unless identical, merge fixtures
- **Generated files**: Regenerate from source
- **Config**: Merge all keys, choose appropriate values
- **Code logic**: Analyze intent, merge if orthogonal, choose one if conflicting
- **Structs**: Include all fields from both branches
- **Deleted-modified**: Backup, analyze, apply to new location

> **Removed in v3.2**: The previous §4.4 "Same-function 5-step protocol" (extract ours/theirs → classify merge mode → document decision) was a custom conflict resolution rule. It has been removed in favor of `resolve-conflicts` skill's Step 4 "Execute Resolution Plan" which provides the same functionality with a more comprehensive framework (7 patterns, decision tracking, user approval flow).

## 5. Checklist

Run all 7 checks before declaring the upstream-merge flow complete. Each is a single command the agent can execute and inspect. Steps (a)–(f) gate the Step 1 merge commit on `main`; step (g) gates the Step 2 propagation into the working branch. A merge is not done until every item is recorded with PASS / N/A / FAIL.

- **(a) All conflicts resolved** — `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U | wc -l` returns 0. If > 0, there are still unresolved hunks; re-walk the decision tree.
- **(b) Pi-coupling markers advisory log (no longer blocking)** — re-run the 5 sub-commands from §4.1 against the post-merge working tree; record the total hit count in the merge commit body. The only acceptable hits are inside `adapters/`, `types/`, or `__tests__/` (legal coupling zones); any hit outside these zones is acceptable (advisory) but should be tracked for the next Pi-coupling reduction cycle. Per v3.1 Phase 13 policy change (2026-07-01), this check no longer blocks the merge — see §4.2b and `docs/upstream-merge-retrospective.md` §2.1.3.
- **(c) TypeScript compiles** — `npx tsc --noEmit` exits 0.
- **(d) Tests are green** — `npm test` (which runs `test:prebuild` then the full vitest suite) exits 0. The quick alternative is `npx vitest run __tests__/adapter-contract.test.ts` for the parametric adapter contract.
- **(e) Divergence check passes — `npm run upstream:check` exits 0** (no stale registry entries; `diverged-but-not-registered` warnings are acceptable, see §4.2a category defaults). The cross-check script replaces the Phase 8 manifest-gap ≤ 10 check; per D-34, exit 1 means stale entries require registry cleanup before the merge commit.
- **(f) Commit message prefix is `upstream-merge:`** — e.g., `upstream-merge: sync v2.10.0 (N files, M conflicts resolved)`. The body should list `ours` / `theirs` / `assess` row counts and any `Refs #N` follow-up issue links.
- **(g) Step 2 propagation complete (skipped if working branch is `main`)** — `git checkout <working-branch> && git merge main` succeeds as a fast-forward or a clean small merge. The working branch now contains the upstream changes from Step 1; if conflicts appear, they are fork-vs-fork, not upstream-vs-fork, and the resolution strategy is the fork's own (consult the relevant Phase plan, not the §4 decision tree). After Step 2, re-run (c) and (d) on the working branch to confirm the propagated state still builds and tests pass.

When steps (a)–(f) PASS, push the merge branch and open a PR per the standard fork workflow (see `references/pi-coupling-markers.md` §"PR template" for the body). When step (g) also PASS, the upstream-merge flow is fully complete on both `main` and the working branch.

## 6. Fork architecture principles (NEW, v3.1)

> **Purpose**: Prevent future merge conflicts at the source, not just resolve them better.
> Source: User insight 2026-07-01 ("fork 引入的代码，如果是独立的，应该独立成文件") + retrospective §3.2.1 L1/L2/L3 decision matrix.

### 6.1 Core principle

**When introducing fork-only code, ALWAYS prefer "独立文件" over "修改 upstream 文件".**

The conflict resolution cost grows with granularity:

| 粒度 | 冲突表现 | 解决成本 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 文件级 | 整个文件 conflict | 🟢 1 行 |
| 段落级 | 文件内某段 conflict | 🟡 需 §4.4 5 步 |
| 函数级 | 同一函数内 conflict | 🟠 需 §4.4 5 步 |
| 行级大块 | 同一函数 343 行同时被改 | 🔴 灾难 |

**Target: 把所有 fork 引入的独立代码推到"文件级"粒度。**

### 6.2 L1/L2/L3 decision matrix (for current fork state)

> Full matrix in `docs/upstream-merge-retrospective.md` §3.2.1.

| Layer | Category | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **L1** | REPLACEMENTS（9 个 Phase 3 抽象改造）| **接受冲突**——撤回 = 撤销 universal 目标 |
| **L2** | ADDITIONS（8 个 fork 加 universal 段）| 大部分已优化（Phase 12 删除 per-agent）；剩余不值得抽 |
| **L3** | TESTS（~10 个 fork universal 测试）| 按 Plan 14-04 拆 init-elicitation |

### 6.3 Future-proofing rules (apply to all new fork code)

When adding new fork-only functionality:

1. **New agent adapter** → create `adapters/<new-agent>.ts`, NOT modify `adapters/entry.ts`
2. **New test scenario** → create `__tests__/<new-scenario>.test.ts`, NOT extend existing `__tests__/init-*.test.ts`
3. **New abstract type** → extend `interfaces/agent-api.ts`, NOT import Pi types directly in core
4. **New universal helper** → create `adapters/<helper>.ts` or `utils/<helper>.ts`, NOT add as inline closure in `entry.ts`
5. **New fork-only documentation** → create `docs/<new-topic>.md`, NOT extend `docs/upstream-merge-retrospective.md` in place (use references + cross-links)

**Anti-pattern**: Adding a new `registerCommand` or `registerTool` call inline in `adapters/entry.ts` `createMcpAdapter` body. This creates future merge conflict at the function level (243-line function body).

**Correct pattern**: Create a new file like `adapters/commands/<new-command>.ts` exporting a `setup<NewCommand>(agentapi, getState, getInitPromise)` function, then call that function from `createMcpAdapter`.

### 6.4 Pre-commit guardrail (CI in Phase 15)

Phase 15 P2-3 will add a CI check that runs:

```bash
# Count: new files vs modified files in this PR
new_files=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=A origin/main...HEAD | wc -l)
modified_files=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=M origin/main...HEAD | wc -l)

# Warn if too many modifications relative to new files
# (suggests inline additions rather than new file extractions)
ratio=$(echo "scale=2; $modified_files / ($new_files + 1)" | bc)
if (( $(echo "$ratio > 2.0" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "⚠ High modify-to-new ratio: $ratio. Consider extracting independent code to new files."
fi
```

**Target ratio**: ≤ 2.0 modifications per new file. If exceeded, PR review should consider whether fork code could be extracted to a new file.

### 6.5 Cross-references

- `docs/upstream-merge-retrospective.md` §3.2.1 — full L1/L2/L3 matrix with empirical data (249 fork-only commits, 278 diverged files)
- `docs/upstream-merge-retrospective.md` §2.4 — multi-perspective reflection on conflict granularity
- SKILL.md §1 — Two-step git merge flow (the merge strategy that this principle supports)

### 6.6 Code structure optimization: how to reduce future conflicts (v3.2)

Based on the 2026-07-01 first merge attempt (11 conflicts, 249 fork-only commits, 278 diverged files), the following code structure changes would reduce future conflict frequency:

**1. Fork-only code in independent files (not modify upstream files)**

When adding new fork-only functionality, create new files — do NOT add code to upstream files that upstream will also modify:

- ✅ New agent adapter → `adapters/<new-agent>.ts` (not modify `adapters/entry.ts`)
- ✅ New test scenario → `__tests__/<new-scenario>.test.ts` (not extend `__tests__/init-*.test.ts`)
- ✅ New abstract type → extend `interfaces/agent-api.ts` (not import Pi types in core)
- ✅ New universal helper → `adapters/<helper>.ts` or `utils/<helper>.ts` (not inline in `entry.ts`)
- ✅ New fork-only doc → `docs/<new-topic>.md` (not extend `docs/upstream-merge-retrospective.md` in place)

**2. Avoid large functions that both sides will modify** (REVISED 2026-07-02: heuristic, not absolute)

The 2026-07-01 attempt showed `adapters/entry.ts` `createMcpAdapter` (324 lines) as the hardest conflict — both fork and upstream modify the same function body. Break large functions into smaller, independently-modifiable units:

- ❌ One 324-line function → ✅ 4 small functions (~80 lines each) + thin orchestrator
- ❌ Inline session lifecycle in `createMcpAdapter` → ✅ Extract to `setupSessionHandlers()`
- ❌ Inline command registration → ✅ Extract to `registerCommands()`

> **Heuristic, not absolute rule** (REVISED 2026-07-02): "Large function" is not well-defined — 30 lines of pure logic is large, but 300+ lines of YAML/JSON/case-statement config may be reasonable. Use `npm run check:large-functions` (default 300 lines) as a **heuristic indicator**, not an absolute threshold. A function being detected as "large" does NOT automatically mean it should be refactored — **refactor only if**:
>
> 1. The function is in a file that both fork and upstream actively modify (verify with `git log upstream/main..main -- <file>` + `git log main..upstream/main -- <file>`)
> 2. AND the function has been the source of past merge conflicts (check retrospective)
> 3. AND the function's body is "structurally simple" (not just long due to data tables/cases)
>
> If any of the above conditions is false, the line count is not a merge-conflict risk — leave it alone. **The root cause of merge conflicts is "both sides modify the same function", not "the function is long".**

**3. Keep import sections stable**

Import conflicts are the easiest to resolve but still cost time. Minimize import churn:

- Use `interfaces/agent-api.ts` abstractions instead of direct Pi type imports (fork-specific imports don't conflict with upstream Pi imports)
- Group imports consistently (std → external → internal → relative)
- When adding a new dependency, add it in a new file, not in an existing core file

**4. Separate fork-only config from upstream config**

- ✅ Fork config in `.planning/` (fork-only, never conflicts)
- ✅ Fork CI in `.github/workflows/` (fork-only, never conflicts)
- ❌ Fork config inline in `package.json` or `tsconfig.json` (shared with upstream, will conflict)

**5. Run `npm run upstream:check` before every PR**

The `--json` mode (CI-02) provides machine-readable divergence data. Use it to detect new divergence early.
